This is a collection of homebrew (as in beer) stuff I've made or find useful.

# Things I've Made

## Hop Aging Calculator

This is an [online tool](https://hopscalculator.chrisspeck.com/) that brewers can use to adjust their hop dosing so that they can hit their target IBUs.

## Brewtarget

My fork of Brewtarget that adds:

- automatically built [binaries for Ubuntu & Arch Linux](https://github.com/cgspeck/brewtarget/releases)
- automatically built [Docker Guaci Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cgspeck/brewtarget-guacgui) so you can run it in a browser

## DIY single vessel brewer

See my post on Aussie Home Brewer detailing [my Braumiester clone](https://aussiehomebrewer.com/threads/speckybraumonster-2-1.99793/#post-1528116).

# Things I find useful
