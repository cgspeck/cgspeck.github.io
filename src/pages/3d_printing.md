### Prusa MMU2 Enclosure

This section relates to my build of a [MMU2 Enclosure](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/mmu2s-printer-enclosure_30215/),

Screw gauge conversions were taken from [this table](https://www.anzor.com.au/gauge-millimeter-conversion-chart).

I will update this table after the build is done.
